# open-beat-control

Provides a subset of
[beat-link](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link#beat-link)
features over [Open Sound
Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control).

> :construction: This project is at a very early stage of development
> and is not yet ready for widespread use.

## Background

This project is intended for people who want to use the beat-link
library to integrate with Pioneer DJ equipment, but are running in a
non-JVM environment (like [PureData](https://puredata.info) or
[Max](https://cycling74.com/products/max/)), or who need to run a
lightweight headless process (that is, with no attached monitor,
keyboard, and mouse for the GUI) on something like a Raspberry Pi, and
thus are unable to take advantage of the features of [Beat Link
Trigger](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link-trigger#beat-link-trigger).

To begin with, only a few features will be supported, but over time
(and based on interest and requests) more will be added as practical
approaches can be identified. The
[Carabiner](https://github.com/brunchboy/carabiner#carabiner)
integration currently provided by
[beat-carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-carabiner#beat-carabiner)
is expected to be an early addition, and that project will turn into a
library shared by both this project and Beat Link Trigger itself, to
solve the problem of diverging features and stale code.

### Why OSC?

Open Sound Control is a strange protocol, and makes some aspects of
implementing an API awkward (there is no intrinsic support for
requests with responses), but it is widely supported in the kind of
experimental music environments that are most likely to benefit from a
project like this.

## Installation

Install a Java runtime, and the latest `open-beat-control.jar` from
the
[releases](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/open-beat-control/releases)
page on your target hardware.

> :construction: There are no releases yet, but brave souls may
> [download](https://deepsymmetry.org/media/open-beat-control.jar) a
> development build.

You may be able to get by with Java 6, but a current release will
perform better and have more recent security updates.

You can either open-beat-control manually when you want to use it, or
configure it to start when your system boots.

## Usage

To start open-beat-control manually, run:

    $ java -jar open-beat-control.jar

It will log to the terminal window in which you are running it. If you
instead want to run it at system startup, you will probably also want
to set a log-file path, so it logs to a rotated log file in your
standard system logs directory, something like:

    $ java -jar open-beat-control.jar -L /var/log/open-beat-control.log

Other options allow you to specify the port number on which its OSC
server listens, and there will be more to come.

### Options

    -o, --osc-port PORT        17002  Port number of OSC server
    -L, --log-file PATH               Log to a rotated file instead of stdout
    -h, --help                        Display help information and exit

## User Guide

To learn how to communicate with Open Beat Control, and the OSC
messages you can send and receive, please see the
[User Guide](https://obc-guide.deepsymmetry.org/).

## Funding

Open Beat Control is, and will remain, completely free and
open-source. If it has helped you, taught you something, or pleased
you, let us know and share some of your discoveries and code as
described above. If you&rsquo;d like to financially support its
ongoing development, you are welcome (but by no means obligated) to
donate to offset the hundreds of hours of research, development, and
writing that have already been invested. Or perhaps to facilitate
future efforts, tools, toys, and time to explore.

## Compatibility

This is in no way a sanctioned implementation of the protocols. It should be clear, but:

> :warning: Use at your own risk! For example, there are reports that
> the XDJ-RX (and XDJ-RX2) crash when Beat Link starts, so don&rsquo;t
> use it with one on your network. As Pioneer themselves
> [explain](https://forums.pioneerdj.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/203113059-xdj-rx-as-single-deck-on-pro-dj-link-),
> the XDJ-RX does not actually implement the protocol:
>
> &ldquo;The LINK on the RX [and RX2] is ONLY for linking to rekordbox
> on your computer or a router with WiFi to connect rekordbox mobile.
> It can not exchange LINK data with other CDJs or DJMs.&rdquo;

While these techniques appear to work for us so far, there are many
gaps in our knowledge, and things could change at any time with new
releases of hardware or even firmware updates from Pioneer.

You should also not expect to be able to run Open Beat Control, or any
project like it, on the same machine that you are running rekordbox,
because they will compete over access to network ports.

Open Beat Control seems to work great with CDJ-2000 Nexus gear, and
works fairly well (with less information available) with older
CDJ-2000s. It has also been reported to work with XDJ-1000 gear. If
you can try it with anything else, *please* let us know what you learn
in the [Beat Link Trigger Gitter chat
room](https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger), or if you have
worked out actionable details about something that could be improved,
[open an
Issue](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/open-beat-control/issues) or
submit a pull request so we can all improve our understanding
together.

If something isn&rsquo;t working with your hardware and you don&rsquo;t yet know
the details why, but are willing to learn a little and help figure it
out, look at the
[dysentery project](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery#dysentery),
which is where we are organizing the research tools and results which
made programs like Open Beat Control possible.

## Startup Issues

If you downloaded the `.jar` version and are using a recent Java
distribution, double-clicking doesn&rsquo;t open up the application,
so open a terminal window and run it from the command line:

    java -jar open-beat-control.jar

If that does not work, at least you will be able to see a detailed
report of what went wrong, which can help you troubleshoot the issue.

Make sure you have a current OpenJDK distribution installed (we build
releases with [Amazon Corretto
11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html)).
