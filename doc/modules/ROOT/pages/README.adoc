This is an introduction to the Open Beat Control utility, describing
the OSC messages you can use to interact with it. This guide shows
some ways you can use it, but as an open-ended environment, the
possibilities are endless. If you have questions or other approaches
you’d like to share, please post to the
https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Beat Link Trigger Gitter
chat room].

To keep page sizes manageable, this guide is split into several pages.
It is worth reading through this whole guide once if you are new to
Open Beat Control. Once you know what you are looking for, you can
also dive right into it by jumping to the page you want using the
navigation menu on the left.

[[startup]]
== Startup

When you launch Open Beat Control, it does not display any visible
user interface, it simply logs out informational messages to the
console (or to the log file you have specified in the command-line
arguments you provided). This is because, unlike the rich GUI of
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link-trigger[Beat Link Trigger],
this project is intended to be used on less-powerful computers which
often lack displays completely. The log can be viewed to troubleshoot
issues when things are not working the way you expect, but your
general interaction with the program will be by sending and receiving
OSC messages.

Hopefully this guide has been enough to get you started, and thinking
about interesting ways you can synchronize your CDJs with other
elements of your show. (If you have not yet read the other pages in
the guide, please do so, either using the “Learning More” links in
each page—like the one right above—or by exploring the navigation menu
on the left.)

If you have any thoughts, questions, your own integration examples, or
even crazy ideas, please share them in the
https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Beat Link Trigger Gitter
chat]!

If you find what seems to be an actual problem with the software,
please open an
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/open-beat-control/issues[Issue], or
at least check whether someone else already has.

Thanks for reading this, and have fun with Open Beat Control! I hope
to hear from you.

=== Funding

Open Beat Control is, and will remain, completely free and
open-source. If it has helped you, taught you something, or pleased
you, let us know and share some of your discoveries and code as
described above. If you’d like to financially support its ongoing
development, you are welcome (but by no means obligated) to donate
towards the hundreds of hours of research, development, and writing
that have already been invested. Or perhaps to facilitate future
efforts, tools, toys, and time to explore.
