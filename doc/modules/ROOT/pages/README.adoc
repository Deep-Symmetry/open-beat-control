= Open Beat Control User Guide
James Elliott <james@deepsymmetry.org>

This is an introduction to the Open Beat Control utility, describing
the OSC messages you can use to interact with it. This guide shows
some ways you can use it, but as an open-ended environment, the
possibilities are endless. If you have questions or other approaches
you’d like to share, please post to the
https://gitter.im/brunchboy/beat-link-trigger[Beat Link Trigger Gitter
chat room].

To keep page sizes manageable, this guide is split into several pages.
It is worth reading through this whole guide once if you are new to
Open Beat Control. Once you know what you are looking for, you can
also dive right into it by jumping to the page you want using the
navigation menu on the left.

[[startup]]
== Startup

When you launch Open Beat Control, it does not display any visible
user interface, it simply logs out informational messages to the
console (or to the log file you have specified in the command-line
arguments you provided). This is because, unlike the rich GUI of
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link-trigger[Beat Link Trigger],
this project is intended to be used on less-powerful computers which
often lack displays completely. The log can be viewed to troubleshoot
issues when things are not working the way you expect, but your
general interaction with the program will be by sending and receiving
OSC messages.

Details of how to obtain Open Beat Control and the Java environment
needed to run it can be found on the
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/open-beat-control#installation[project
page].

Assuming you have configured your command path so that the JDK's
`java` command is available, you can start Open Beat Control by simply
typing the following command in a terminal session (or include it in a
shell or command script):

----
java -jar open-beat-control.jar
----

This will log any informational and error messages to the terminal
window in which you are running it.

[NOTE]
====
You will see warnings about "illegal reflective access operations."
This is normal and currently unavoidable, because several of the
libraries used by Beat Link Trigger have not been updated to be
compatible with the Java Module System introduced in Java 9. That may
never happen; modules radically changed the rules, and the "future
release" where these rules are enforced may never come.
====

If you are configuring your system startup scripts to run Open Beat
Control, you probably also want to set up a log-file path, so that
these messages are sent to a rotated log file in your standard system
logs directory, along these lines:

----
java -jar open-beat-control.jar -L /var/log/open-beat-control.log
----

[TIP]
====
If you are running on a Mac, and want to avoid having a useless "java"
dock icon appear, with a menubar that has no helpful content, you can
tell Java that this is a background-only application with no user
interface by adding `-Dapple.awt.UIElement=true` before the `-jar`
section of the `java` invocation:

----
java -Dapple.awt.UIElement=true -jar open-beat-control.jar
----
====

There are other command-line options you can use as well.

[[options]]
=== Options

----
-o, --osc-port PORT        17002  Port number for OSC server
-r, --real-player                 Try to pose as a real CDJ (device #1-4)
-d, --device-number NUM           Use fixed device # (overrides -r)
-B, --bridge                      Use Carabiner to bridge to Ableton Link
-a, --ableton-master              When bridging, Ableton Link tempo wins
-b, --beat-align                  When bridging, sync to beats only, not bars
-c, --carabiner-port PORT  17000  When bridging, port # of Carabiner daemon
-l, --latency MS           20     How many milliseconds are we behind the CDJs
-L, --log-file PATH               Log to a rotated file instead of stdout
-h, --help                        Display help information and exit
----

By default, Open Beat Control listens for OSC messages on port 17002,
so that is what you would configure your other software to talk to. If
there is a reason you need to use a different port number instead
(perhaps other software is already using port 17002), you can supply
the `-o` or `--osc-port` option, along with a port number, to specify
an alternate port for receiving OSC messages.

The normal mode of operation is for Open Beat Control to look and see
what devices are already on the network, and pick an unused device
number to avoid conflicts. If you want to tell it to use a specific
device number instead, see <<use-fixed-device,Specifying a Device
Number>> below.

[[pose-as-real-cdj]]
==== Posing as a real CDJ

Unless you supply the `-r` or `--real-player` option, the Beat Link
library will use an unused device number greater than 4. This means it
can safely operate even when there are four real CDJs on the network
(they will be using numbers 1 through 4). Thanks to a lot of clever
research and trickery, we have figured out how to get most features
working even when operating in this mode.

But some things are simply impossible: if you want to be able to
control the tempo of the CDJs, then Beat Link needs to be using a real
player number. Passing this option tells it to try; if you have four
players on the network, you will have to turn one of them off before
starting Open Beat Control for this to work.

[[use-fixed-device]]
==== Specifying a Device Number

If you always want Open Beat Control to use a specific device number,
you can configure that by supplying the `-d` or `--device-number`
option along with the number that you would like to use, which must be
in the range 1 through 127 (although you should probably stick to the
range 1-15 to avoid conflicting with rekordbox and mixers). When you
do this, passing `-r` or `--real-player` has no effect: you can choose
to use a number in the real player range (1 through 4) or not. It is
your responsibility to be sure that no other device on the network is
trying to use the same number.

WARNING: If you tell Open Beat Control to use a specific device
number, and there is an actual device using that number on the
network, that device will defend its use of the number, and Open Beat
Control will repeatedly fail to go online until the other device is
disconnected or turned off. Or, if the other device is an XDJ-XZ, it
does not properly implement the conflict resolution protocol, and you
will end up with two devices on the same number, which will not work
in any useful way. So only use this option if you really need to, and
are careful about what you are doing.

If you've plugged Open Beat Control into a mixer ethernet port that is
assigned to a particular channel, the mixer will tell Open Beat
Control what channel to use, and this will override your attempt to
specify a device number.

==== Bridging to Ableton Link

If you would like to allow the DJ Link network to control the tempo
and beat alignment of an Ableton Link session (or vice versa), you can
supply the `-B` or `--bridge` option.

NOTE: As long as you are running Open Beat Control on one of the
common operating systems and processor architectures that are
supported by
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/lib-carabiner#lib-carabiner[lib-carabiner],
there is nothing else you need to install or run, and a built-in copy
of Carabiner will be started when you need it. If you are on a
different platform, you will need to build, install and run
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner#carabiner[Carabiner] on
your own.

With either approach, Open Beat Control can tie into an
https://www.ableton.com/en/link/[Ableton Link] session, so you can
synchronize programs like Ableton Live, Traktor, and an increasing
collection of others (as well as more and more hardware), to the tempo
and beat grid established by the players.

If you don't want Carabiner to communicate on its standard port number
17000, you can use the `-c` or `--carabiner-port` option to tell Open
Beat Control which port to use for Carabiner (which will configure
Carabiner itself if Open Beat Control is managing it, or just tell
Open Beat Control where to find it if you are running your own copy.

By default, Open Beat Control will align the Ableton Link session
timeline with the DJ Link tempo grid at the level of entire musical
bars, so the down beats fall at the same time. If you don't trust the
down beat assignments of tracks on the CDJs, you can tell it to align
at the level of individual beats instead, using the `-b` or
`--beat-align` option.

If the beat alignment seems to be slightly off, you can tweak it by
adjusting the latency value using the `-l` or `--latency` option.

The normal mode of operation is for Open Beat Control to tie the
Ableton Link session to the player that is the Tempo Master on the DJ
Link network. If you would like synchronization to happen in the other
direction, so that the Pioneer players are synced to the Ableton Link
session, you can use the `-a` or `--ableton-master` option, as long as
Open Beat Control is <<pose-as-real-cdj,posing as a real CDJ>>, or if
you <<use-fixed-device,specified a device number>> it was in the range
1 through 4.

As long as you turned on bridging at startup (and as long as you are
using an appropriate player number if you want Ableton Link to be the
tempo master) you can change which network (and which player) is
controlling the tempo at any time using <<Messages#messages,OSC messages>>.

Hopefully this guide has been enough to get you started, and thinking
about interesting ways you can synchronize your CDJs with other
elements of your show. (If you have not yet read the other pages in
the guide, please do so, either using the “Learning More” links in
each page—like the one right above—or by exploring the navigation menu
on the left.)

If you have any thoughts, questions, your own integration examples, or
even crazy ideas, please share them in the

If you find what seems to be an actual problem with the software,
please open an
https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/open-beat-control/issues[Issue], or
at least check whether someone else already has.

Thanks for reading this, and have fun with Open Beat Control! I hope
to hear from you.
