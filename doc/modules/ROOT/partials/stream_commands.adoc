==== Commands

`list`:: Sends responses with all {stream-type}s currently known.

`stream`:: Starts out just like the `list` command, but will also send
responses any time a {stream-type} change is seen on the network, until
you send a `stop` command. You can have more than one {stream-type}
stream running at the same time if you use different port numbers to
set them up.

`stop`:: Stops sending messages as {stream-type}s change. You must specify the
same port number (or lack of one) as you used when setting up the
stream.
